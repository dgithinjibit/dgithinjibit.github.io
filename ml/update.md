 Hi there, I'm a developer learning and building things.

What I'm currently focused on:

ðŸš€ I'm diving deep into **DVC (Data Version Control)** and **Kubeflow** to master the MLOps pipeline. My goal is to build reproducible and scalable machine learning workflows.

**Today's Learning Log:**

* **Problem:** Ran into a `403 Forbidden` error with DVC and AWS S3. Turns out, the issue was a mix of incorrect IAM user credentials (I was using console login details instead of programmatic access keys) and a misconfigured remote bucket name.
* **Solution:** Learned how to create and configure proper IAM user access keys. I also learned to troubleshoot the issue by carefully checking the AWS console to match the exact bucket name in my DVC remote add command.
* **Lesson:** The most important skill isn't knowing everything, but knowing how to ask the right questions to get unstuck. My "pair programming partner" (a prompt engineer) was instrumental in this process, guiding me through the cloud configuration nuances. This experience reinforced the value of treating AI as a tool for problem-solving, not just for writing code.
