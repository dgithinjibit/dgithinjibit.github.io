    <h2>Core Principles for a Modern Developer</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): The backbone of rapid, reliable delivery. Get comfortable with it.</li>
        <li>Security from Day One: Don't bolt it on later. Secure your code and infrastructure from the start.</li>
        <li>The Business Value of Code: Your code isn't just an art project; it solves a business problem. Always know the "why."</li>
        <li>Embrace the Open-Source Movement: Learn, contribute, and collaborate. It's the new standard for building.</li>
        <li>Fail Fast: Don't be afraid to experiment and pivot. Learning from mistakes is the fastest path to success.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Essential Tools for the 2025 Developer Stack</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>AI Pair-Programming Tools: Tools like GitHub Copilot or AI built into IDEs. Your new best friend.</li>
        <li>Serverless Platforms: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions. The future is function-based.</li>
        <li>Containerization & Orchestration: Docker and Kubernetes. Essential for managing complex applications.</li>
        <li>Low-Code/No-Code Platforms: For rapid prototyping and building internal tools. Don't be too proud to use them.</li>
        <li>Observability Platforms: Tools like Datadog or Prometheus. If you can't see what's happening, you're flying blind.</li>
    </ol>
